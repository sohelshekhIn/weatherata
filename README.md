weatherata -The Fast and Secure weather app

weaterata is an Weather App developed using DarkSky Weather API and GEO Code Location API.
The site is hosted in firebase hosting [weatherata.web.app](weatherata.web.app)

This was my first site every made and the start of my programming journey.
I know the UI is not that best, but is good in campare to first try.

This project also uses 3rd Party packages for Notification and Re-asking location permission in the browser.
